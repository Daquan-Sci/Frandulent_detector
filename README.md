About

Healthcare Provider Fraud Detection is a project aimed at predicting potentially fraudulent providers in the healthcare industry. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze Medicare data and identify patterns associated with fraudulent behavior by providers.
Dataset

The project utilizes a Medicare dataset containing information on healthcare claims, provider details, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is used to train machine learning models for predicting potentially fraudulent providers.
Project Objectives

The primary objectives of the project include:

    Understanding Provider Fraud: Explore the problem of provider fraud in the healthcare industry and its impact on Medicare spending.
    Dataset Analysis: Analyze the provided Medicare dataset to identify patterns and trends related to fraudulent behavior by providers.
    Model Development: Build machine learning models to predict potentially fraudulent providers based on the analyzed dataset.
    Evaluation and Validation: Evaluate the performance of the developed models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
    Risk Mitigation: Use the predictive models to identify high-risk providers and implement measures to mitigate the risk of fraudulent claims.

Problem Statement

The goal of the project is to predict potentially fraudulent providers in the healthcare industry. By leveraging machine learning models trained on Medicare data, the project aims to detect and prevent healthcare fraud, ultimately leading to cost savings for insurance companies and improved healthcare affordability for consumers.
